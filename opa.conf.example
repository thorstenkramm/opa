# Base directory to store backups, logs, and metadata. Mandatory.
# Directory must exist.

# Older versions will be removed.
# Default: 1

# Whether to delete old versions before or after the current backup
# Default: false (delete old backups after the current backup)
# Requires: skip_unchanged_dbs = false

# Perform backup using streamcompress. This creates a single archive with all files individually compressed by qpress.
# Fastest backup with lowest disk space consumption.
# Requires additional steps to restore. Mutually exclusive with prepare and tgz.
# Default: false

# Run the prepare step after the backup.
# Mutually exclusive with streamcompress.
# Default: false

# How many subroutines to run in parallel. Optional.
# Negative values are subtracted from total CPUs.
# -2 on 10 CPUs means a parallelism of 8.
# If a negative value would lead to parallelism of 0 or less, 1 is used.
# Setting also applies to tar.gz compression when the pigz utility is found.
# Default: number of CPUs

# If any of the commands defined in the terminate_conditions list exits with exit code > 0,
# an error is logged and the backup is considered faulty.
# This is useful for, e.g., copying backups to remote storage.
# On first exit code > 0, the rest of the commands are skipped.
